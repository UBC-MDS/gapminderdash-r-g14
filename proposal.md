# Project Proposal

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Group of students aiming to faciliate access to metrics derived from gapminder dataset to a non-technical audience.

Target audience: Non-technical individuals who wish to explore insights derived from the gapminder dataset.

Socioeconomic measures are vital to studies of trends relating to the prosperity - or lack thereof - of countries across the world. As global population has steadily increased over the past several decades, so too has life expectancy and average income per capita. However, the rate at which these quantities have evolved has been predominantly non-uniform across continents and the countries therein. It is therefore critical to facilitate access to data relating to these quantities for subject matter experts in a way which allows them to query the information most relevant to their area of study or research. Our solution is to develop an interactive dashboard which exposes these socioeconomic measures to non-technical users while giving them control to specify their country(ies) of interest.

## Description of the data

The Gapminder dataset is a collection of observations made at 5-year intervals between 1952 and 2007 for 142 unique countries. Each observation includes a country-specific, numeric measure for life expectancy (`lifeExp`), GDP per capita (`gdpPercap`), and population (`pop`). Each row of data corresponds to a unique year-country pair.

## Research questions and usage scenarios

Jane is a Bachelor of Arts, International Development student at UBC. She is writing a paper in which she compares 20th century socioeconomic development in Afghanistan to that of other Asian countries.

Through our proposed dashboard, Jane is easily able to identify, visualize, and compare key socioeconomic indicators across countries and continents. Upon loading the app, she filters the data on the dashboard to show only Asian country data. In one chart, she can see the evolution over time of all Asian countries' GDP per capita, life expectancy, or population. Another chart shows those countries' positions relative to one another by measure of life expectancy as a function of their GDP per capita. She applies a new filter to the dashboard; this time selecting the countries Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Along with other continental and country-level metrics available in the dashboard, Jane is able to formulate some high level assumptions about the state of growth of Afghanistan relative to its neighbouring countries. She can use her observations from the dashboard to pursue supporting information pertinent to the periods of time which show the greatest/poorest growth of the country.
